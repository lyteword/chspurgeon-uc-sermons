# No. 1 - The Immutability of God

> "I am the Lord, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed." - Malachi 3:6

The immutability of God: all creatures change but God is the same. He changes not in his attributes. The existence and being of God imply immutability. God rules and governs all things. I believe God to be a perfect being. If he is a perfect being, he cannot change. Again, there is God's infinity, which puts change out of the question. Who are "the sons of Jacob," who can rejoice in an immutable God? They are the sons of God's election. They have talked with God as a man talks with his friend; Christ has been with them, and they with Christ. They are men of peculiar character. There was Jacob's faith, by which Jacob had his name written among the mighty worthies who obtained not the promises on earth, but shall obtain in heaven. Is faith the rule of your life? If so, you are the sons of Jacob. Jacob was a man of prayer. Sons of God must pray. If you are living without prayer, you are living without Christ. But you who are the sons of Jacob take comfort, for God is immutable, "Therefore ye sons Jacob are not consumed." How can man be consumed? We might have been consumed in hell but there is a way of being consumed in this world; there is such a things as being condemned before you die. Oh! If he had changed, we should have been consumed. Remember God is the same; every thing may change, but God does not.
